        <h1>REACT.JS</h1>
        <h2>What is React.js?</h2>
        <p>React.js is an open-source JavaScript library created by Facebook in 2011, aiming to simplify the intricate process of building interactive UIs.</p>

        <h3>History:</h3>
        <p>Back in 2011, Facebook wanted to offer a richer user experience through a more dynamic and more responsive user interface that was fast and highly performant.</p>
        <p>Jordan Walke, one of Facebook's software engineers, solved this problem by creating <strong>React</strong>. It simplified the development process by offering a more systematic approach to creating dynamic and interactive user interfaces through reusable components.</p>

        <h3>Features:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>One-way Data Binding</strong> - In React, data flows in a single direction: from parent components to child components.</li>
            <li><strong>Optimized Performance</strong> - React uses virtual DOM and updates only the modified parts, making the DOM run faster.</li>
            <li><strong>Extensions</strong> - React offers a variety of extensions that enable the development of comprehensive UI applications.</li>
            <li><strong>Component-Based</strong> - React.js divides the web page into multiple components as it is component-based.</li>
            <li><strong>Simplicity</strong> - Due to the component-based and reusable system of React, it makes code easy to understand, debug, and has less code.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to Install React.js?</h2>
        <h3>Step 1: Install NodeJS</h3>
        <p>- Download the current version of Node.js <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer/current" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
        <p>- Install and just click the <strong>Next</strong> until it is finished.</p>

        <h3>Step 2: Verify NodeJS Installation</h3>
        <p>- Open command prompt and run this in the terminal:</p>
        <pre><code>node -v</code></pre>
        <p>- The prompt shall display the version you installed.</p>

        <h3>Step 3: Install the CRA package</h3>
        <p>- Again, in the terminal, run the following command to install create-react-app:</p>
        <pre><code>npm install -g create-react-app</code></pre>
        <p>- To verify if the installation went well, run the following command:</p>
        <pre><code>create-react-app --version</code></pre>
        <p>- The prompt shall display the version you installed.</p>

        <h3>Step 4: Create Directory for React Projects</h3>
        <p>- Create a new folder where you will make your react app through this command:</p>
        <pre><code>mkdir newfolder</code></pre>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> The <em>newfolder</em> is the name of the folder, you can change it.</p>
        <p>- Move into the folder you created through this command:</p>
        <pre><code>cd newfolder</code></pre>

        <h3>Step 5: Create the React App</h3>
        <p>- Inside the created folder, run the following command and wait for the installation to finish:</p>
        <pre><code>npx create-react-app reactfirst</code></pre>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> The app's name must be created using <ins>lowercase letters</ins> only due to npm naming restrictions.</p>

        <h3>Step 6: Open the Project in a Code Editor</h3>
        <p>- Open the project folder in your chosen IDE. <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a> is highly recommended.</p>
        <p>- Inside the <
